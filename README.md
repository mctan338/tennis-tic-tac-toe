## Introduction
Tennis Tic Tac Toe combines the traditional gameplay of Tic Tac Toe with a tennis theme. Players take turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row while enjoying a sporty aesthetic.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
